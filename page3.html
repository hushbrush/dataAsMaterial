    <p class="page3">GO PLACIDLY AMID THE NOISE AND THE HASTE, <BR><BR>AND REMEMBER WHAT PEACE THERE MAY BE IN SILENCE. <BR><BR>AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, WITHOUT SURRENDER, BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ALL PERSONS.<BR><BR>

      SPEAK YOUR TRUTH QUIETLY AND CLEARLY; <BR><BR>AND LISTEN TO OTHERS, EVEN TO THE DULL AND THE IGNORANT; <BR>THEY TOO HAVE THEIR STORY.<BR><BR>
      
      AVOID LOUD AND AGGRESSIVE PERSONS; <BR>THEY ARE VEXATIOUS TO THE SPIRIT. <BR><BR>IF YOU COMPARE YOURSELF WITH OTHERS, YOU MAY BECOME VAIN OR BITTER,<BR> FOR ALWAYS THERE WILL BE GREATER AND LESSER PERSONS THAN YOURSELF.
      
      <BR><BR><BR><BR>ENJOY YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS AS WELL AS YOUR PLANS.<BR><BR> KEEP INTERESTED IN YOUR OWN CAREER, HOWEVER HUMBLE;<BR> IT IS A REAL POSSESSION IN THE CHANGING FORTUNES OF TIME.<BR><BR>
      
      EXERCISE CAUTION IN YOUR BUSINESS AFFAIRS,<BR> FOR THE WORLD IS FULL OF TRICKERY.<BR><BR> BUT LET THIS NOT BLIND YOU TO WHAT VIRTUE THERE IS; <BR>MANY PERSONS STRIVE FOR HIGH IDEALS,<BR> AND EVERYWHERE LIFE IS FULL OF HEROISM.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
      
      BE YOURSELF. ESPECIALLY DO NOT FEIGN AFFECTION. <BR>NEITHER BE CYNICAL ABOUT LOVE; <BR><BR>FOR IN THE FACE OF ALL ARIDITY AND DISENCHANTMENT,<BR> IT IS AS PERENNIAL AS THE GRASS.<BR><BR>
      
      TAKE KINDLY THE COUNSEL OF THE YEARS, <BR>GRACEFULLY SURRENDERING THE THINGS OF YOUTH.<BR><BR>
      
      NURTURE STRENGTH OF SPIRIT TO SHIELD YOU IN SUDDEN MISFORTUNE.<BR> BUT DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF WITH DARK IMAGININGS. <BR>MANY FEARS ARE BORN OF FATIGUE AND LONELINESS.<BR><BR>
      
      BEYOND A WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE, BE GENTLE WITH YOURSELF. <BR><BR><BR>YOU ARE A CHILD OF THE UNIVERSE NO LESS THAN THE TREES AND THE STARS;<BR> YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HERE.<BR><BR>
      
      AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS CLEAR TO YOU,<BR> NO DOUBT THE UNIVERSE IS UNFOLDING AS IT SHOULD.<BR><BR> THEREFORE BE AT PEACE WITH GOD,<BR> WHATEVER YOU CONCEIVE HIM TO BE.<BR><BR> AND WHATEVER YOUR LABORS AND ASPIRATIONS,<BR> IN THE NOISY CONFUSION OF LIFE, KEEP PEACE IN YOUR SOUL.<BR><BR> WITH ALL ITS SHAM, DRUDGERY AND BROKEN DREAMS, <BR>IT IS STILL A BEAUTIFUL WORLD. BE CHEERFUL. STRIVE TO BE HAPPY.</p>
