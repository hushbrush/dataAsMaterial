    <p class="page7">
      Go <span class="page7">placidly</span> amid the <div class="page7">noise</div> and the <div class="page7">haste,</div>  
      and remember what <span class="page7">peace</span> there may be in <span class="page7">silence.</span>  
      As far as possible, <span class="page7">without surrender,</span> be on good terms with all persons.  
  
      Speak your truth <span class="page7">quietly</span> and <span class="page7">clearly;</span> and <span class="page7">listen</span> to others, even to the <div class="page7">dull</div> and the <div class="page7">ignorant;</div>  
      they too have their story.  
  
      Avoid <div class="page7">loud</div> and <div class="page7">aggressive</div> persons; they are <div class="page7">vexatious</div> to the spirit.  
      If you compare yourself with others, you may become <div class="page7">vain</div> or <div class="page7">bitter,</div>  
      for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  
  
      Enjoy your <span class="page7">achievements</span> as well as your <span class="page7">plans.</span>  
      Keep interested in your own career, however <span class="page7">humble;</span>  
      it is a <span class="page7">real</span> possession in the changing fortunes of time.  
  
      Exercise <span class="page7">caution</span> in your business affairs,  
      for the world is full of <div class="page7">trickery.</div>  
      But let this not blind you to what <span class="page7">virtue</span> there is;  
      many persons strive for <span class="page7">high ideals,</span>  
      and everywhere life is full of <span class="page7">heroism.</span>  
  
      Be yourself. Especially do not <div class="page7">feign</div> affection.  
      Neither be <div class="page7">cynical</div> about love;  
      for in the face of all <div class="page7">aridity</div> and <div class="page7">disenchantment,</div>  
      it is as <span class="page7">perennial</span> as the grass.  
  
      Take <span class="page7">kindly</span> the counsel of the years,  
      gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  
  
      Nurture <span class="page7">strength</span> of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  
      But do not distress yourself with <div class="page7">dark imaginings.</div>  
      Many <div class="page7">fears</div> are born of <div class="page7">fatigue</div> and <div class="page7">loneliness.</div>  
  
      Beyond a wholesome discipline, be <span class="page7">gentle</span> with yourself.  
      You are a <span class="page7">child</span> of the universe no less than the <span class="page7">trees</span> and the <span class="page7">stars;</span>  
      you have a <span class="page7">right</span> to be here.  
  
      And whether or not it is clear to you,  
      no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  
      Therefore be at <span class="page7">peace</span> with God,  
      whatever you conceive Him to be.  
      And whatever your labors and aspirations,  
      in the <div class="page7">noisy confusion</div> of life, keep <span class="page7">peace</span> in your soul.  
      With all its <div class="page7">sham, drudgery</div> and <div class="page7">broken dreams,</div>  
      it is still a <span class="page7">beautiful</span> world. Be <span class="page7">cheerful.</span> Strive to be <span class="page7">happy.</span>
