      <span>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,</span><br>
      <span>and remember what peace there may be in silence.</span><br>
      <span>As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.</span><br>
      
      <span>Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</span><br>
      <span>and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant;</span><br>
      <span>they too have their story.</span><br>
      
      <span>Avoid loud and aggressive persons;</span><br>
      <span>they are vexatious to the spirit.</span><br>
      <span>If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter,</span><br>
      <span>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</span><br>
      
      <span>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</span><br>
      <span>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</span><br>
      <span>it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</span><br>
      
      <span>Exercise caution in your business affairs,</span><br>
      <span>for the world is full of trickery.</span><br>
      <span>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</span><br>
      <span>many persons strive for high ideals,</span><br>
      <span>and everywhere life is full of heroism.</span><br>
      
      <span>Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection.</span><br>
      <span>Neither be cynical about love;</span><br>
      <span>for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,</span><br>
      <span>it is as perennial as the grass.</span><br>
      
      <span>Take kindly the counsel of the years,</span><br>
      <span>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</span><br>
      
      <span>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</span><br>
      <span>But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</span><br>
      <span>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</span><br>
      
      <span>Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.</span><br>
      <span>You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;</span><br>
      <span>you have a right to be here.</span><br>
      
      <span>And whether or not it is clear to you,</span><br>
      <span>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</span><br>
      <span>Therefore be at peace with God,</span><br>
      <span>whatever you conceive Him to be.</span><br>
      <span>And whatever your labors and aspirations,</span><br>
      <span>in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.</span><br>
      <span>With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams,</span><br>
      <span>it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</span>
