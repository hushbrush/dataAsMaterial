    <p class="page6">Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, <br>and remember what peace there may be in silence. <br>As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. 

        Speak your truth quietly and clearly;  and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; <br>they too have their story. 
        
        Avoid loud and aggressive persons; <br>they are vexatious to the spirit.  If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter,<br> for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
        
         <br>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your own career, however humble;<br> it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. 
        
        Exercise caution in your business affairs,<br> for the world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; <br>many persons strive for high ideals,<br> and everywhere life is full of heroism.  
        
        Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. <br>Neither be cynical about love;  for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,<br> it is as perennial as the grass. 
        
        Take kindly the counsel of the years, <br>gracefully surrendering the things of youth. 
        
        Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br> But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. <br>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. 
        
        Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  <br>You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;<br> you have a right to be here. 
        
        And whether or not it is clear to you,<br> no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God,<br> whatever you conceive Him to be.  And whatever your labors and aspirations,<br> in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, <br>it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>
