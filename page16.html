    <p class="page16">
      <span class="page</p>16">Go placidly amid the noise and the haste,</span>
      <div class="page16">and remember what peace there may be in silence.</div>
      <span class="page16">As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.</span>
      <div class="page16">Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</div>
      <span class="page16">and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant;</span>
      <div class="page16">they too have their story.</div>
  
      <span class="page16">Avoid loud and aggressive persons;</span>
      <div class="page16">they are vexatious to the spirit.</div>
      <span class="page16">If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter,</span>
      <div class="page16">for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</div>
  
      <span class="page16">Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</span>
      <div class="page16">Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</div>
      <span class="page16">it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</span>
      <div class="page16">Exercise caution in your business affairs,</div>
      <span class="page16">for the world is full of trickery.</span>

      <div class="page16">But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</div>
      <span class="page16">many persons strive for high ideals,</span>
      <div class="page16">and everywhere life is full of heroism.</div>
      <span class="page16">Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection.</span>
      <div class="page16">Neither be cynical about love;</div>
      <span class="page16">for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,</span>
      <div class="page16">it is as perennial as the grass.</div>
  
      <span class="page16">Take kindly the counsel of the years,</span>
      <div class="page16">gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</div>
      <span class="page16">Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</span>
      <div class="page16">But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</div>
      <span class="page16">Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</span>
      <div class="page16">Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.</div>
  
      <span class="page16">You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;</span>
      <div class="page16">you have a right to be here.</div>
      <span class="page16">And whether or not it is clear to you,</span>
      <div class="page16">no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</div>
      <span class="page16">Therefore be at peace with God,</span>
      <div class="page16">whatever you conceive Him to be.</div>
  
      <span class="page16">And whatever your labors and aspirations,</span>
      <div class="page16">in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.</div>
      <span class="page16">With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams,</span>
      <div class="page16">it is still a beautiful world.</div>
  
      <span style="font-size: 550%; padding-top: 170%">Be cheerful.</span>
      <div style="font-size: 250%; padding-top: 20%" >Strive to be happy.</div>
