    <p class="page19">Go <strong>placidly</strong> amid the <span>noise</span> and the <span>haste,</span>  
      and remember what <strong>peace</strong> there may be in <strong>silence</strong>.  
      As far as possible, <strong>without surrender,</strong> be on good terms with all persons.  
      
      Speak your truth <strong>quietly and clearly;</strong> and <strong>listen</strong> to others,  
      even to the <span>dull and the ignorant;</span> they too have their story.  
      
      Avoid <span>loud and aggressive</span> persons; they are <span>vexatious</span> to the spirit.  
      If you compare yourself with others, you may become <span>vain</span> or <span>bitter,</span>  
      for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  
      
      Enjoy your <strong>achievements</strong> as well as your <strong>plans.</strong>  
      Keep interested in your own <strong>career,</strong> however humble;  
      it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  
      
      Exercise caution in your business affairs,  
      for the world is full of <span>trickery.</span>  
      But let this not blind you to what <strong>virtue</strong> there is;  
      many persons strive for <strong>high ideals,</strong>  
      and everywhere life is full of <strong>heroism.</strong>  
      
      Be yourself. Especially do not feign <span>affection.</span>  
      Neither be <span>cynical</span> about love;  
      for in the face of all <span>aridity</span> and <span>disenchantment,</span>  
      it is as <strong>perennial</strong> as the <strong>grass.</strong>  
      
      Take <strong>kindly</strong> the counsel of the years,  
      gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  
      
      Nurture <strong>strength</strong> of spirit to shield you in sudden <span>misfortune.</span>  
      But do not distress yourself with <span>dark imaginings.</span>  
      Many fears are born of <span>fatigue</span> and <span>loneliness.</span>  
      
      Beyond a wholesome discipline, be <strong>gentle</strong> with yourself.  
      You are a <strong>child of the universe</strong> no less than the trees and the stars;  
      you have a <strong>right</strong> to be here.  
      
      And whether or not it is clear to you,  
      no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  
      Therefore be at <strong>peace</strong> with God,  
      whatever you conceive Him to be.  
      And whatever your <strong>labors</strong> and <strong>aspirations,</strong>  
      in the <span>noisy confusion</span> of life, keep <strong>peace</strong> in your soul.  
      
      With all its <span>sham,</span> <span>drudgery</span> and <span>broken dreams,</span>  
      it is still a <strong>beautiful world.</strong>  
      <strong>Be cheerful.</strong>  
      <strong>Strive to be happy.</strong></p></body>
